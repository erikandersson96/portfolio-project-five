## Portfolio Project Four
 
### Intention
 
This website is a fictional website for the purpose of my Fifth Portfolio Project for Code Institute’s Full Stack Software Development Course. I created this website with the knowledge I gained from the `Building an E-commerce Platform, Introduction to Search Engine Optimization and Web Marketing` modules in the last section of the course.
 
The main goal of this project was to test my new knowledge in Building an E-commerce Platform with Django, Bootstrap and Stripe as a payment system. 
 
##### Features I aimed to achieve with this project:
* To make the website easy to understand for the user.
* Make sure so the website has good `UI and UX` throughout the whole website so the user doesn't get confuesed.
* Create a easily navigated website with an easy to understand `navigation menu on top and a nice footer at the bottom`.
* Follow a `black and yellow` theme throughout the whole website design.

## Planning
 
### AndWatch's - Balsamiq Wireframe
 
I created a Wireframe for this project to showcase for my mentor what my design idea for this project would look like using [Balsamiq - wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/) (link). But I also created this so I could focus more on designing the actual website instead of having to think to much how the design for this project would look.
 
Instead adding all scrrenshots of my wireframe here I have decided that you can take a look at it by this shared link of my wireframe, [AndWatch's - wireframe]() (link).
 
### Trello - User Stories Board
 
Before I started to work with the code for this project I was requested of my mentor to create a mapping tool for my `user stories` to easier track `what to do when`. So I choose to use `Trello` as my tool for this. During my development I have been moving each user story with it's `EPICS` to the correct stage of the process, and I have made sure that each user story was manualy tested and fully functional before moving on to the next one.
 
If you want to visit my trello board you can do so by visit this [link]() (link).
 
I will demonstrate each step in the process for you down below of my trello board during my development:

## UX
 
#### User Stories
As a guest I would like to be able to:
 
* Register an account using username, email, and password.
* Learn more about the website.
* Visit the website's social platforms.
* View all of the recipes.
* View the recipe details of a selected recipe.
 
As a user I would like to be able to:
 
* Login to my account.
* Add recipes to the list of recipes.
* Edit and delete recipes created by me.
* Make recipes my favorite.
 
As a admin I need to be able to:
 
* See the entire list of recipes that has been added.
* Add recipes to the list of recipes to be viewed by everyone.
* Edit and delete recipes.
#### Strategy
 
* **Project Goal**
Create a website that allows users to create an account so they can see, add and edit recipes.
 
#### Scope
 
* A simple and straightforward UX experience. 
* A navigation bar that is easy to navigate the website with.
* A website that is compatible on most screen devices.

## Logic
 
### AndWatch's - Database Schema
 
Before I started to code this project I created a `Diagram Entity Relationship - Database Schema` using [dbdiagram]() (link). I created this to easier understand the database models that I was going to create for this project.

## Technologies
 
Technologies that I used for `AndWatch's` website project is the following down below.
 
#### Programming Languages
 
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) (link): Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.
 
#### Frameworks & Programs
 
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (link): Django is a high-level `Python web framework` that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.
 
* [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) (link): Bootstrap is a `CSS framework and toolkit`. Developers can't use it to write programs, but because Bootstrap contains massive amounts of reusable code and website element templates, the framework can remove some of the “busy work” and significantly speed up the process of building a website.
 
* [GitHub](https://github.com) (link): GitHub is used to store all data from the project after it has been pushed using the
`git add . | git commit -m "message here" | git push` command in the GitPod terminal.
 
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io) (link): I used `GitPod` as my `IDE` that stands for `An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software for building applications that combines common developer tools into a single graphical user interface (GUI)`. You can read more about this [here](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/gitpod-launch) (link).
 
* `Git`: This is used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub. Incase someting unexpected happens to your gitpod workspace, everything is committed to your GitHub repository.
 
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (link): Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service `(PaaS)`. Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
 
* [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) (link): Lucidchart is the intelligent diagramming application that empowers teams to clarify complexity, logic and more. To get a better visual understanding about how an application work.
 
* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) (link): Is a validation tool that I used to validate my code.
 
* [Techsini](https://techsini.com/multi-mockup/index.php) (link). Used to create the mockup image.
 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (link). Was used to add icons for my social media links.
 
* [Pair Fonts](https://pairfonts.com/) (link). I used Pair Fonts to add custome fonts for the aesthetic and UX purposes.
 
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) (link). Balsamiq was used to create my wireframe for my design process.
 
* [dbdiagram](https://dbdiagram.io/home) (link). dbdiagram was used to create my database schema before I started to code my project.
 
* [Trello](https://trello.com/) (link). Trello was used for creating my board for mapping my user stories in this project.
 
* [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) (link). Favicon was used to create the little icon that is showing in the browser adress bar to make the user experience more professional for the website.

## Deployment
 
**GitHub:**
 
I frequently used `commit` throughout the whole project, this is the commands used in the terminal:
 
* `git add .` (This command is used for adding files to the staging area before committing).
* `git commit -m “commit message here..”` (This is used to label the commit changes made to the local repository).
* `git push` (This command is used to push all changes to the Github repository).
 
This is all done to prevent any `data` loss in case Gitpod crashes and saves the `data` to GitHub.
 
 
### GitHub & Gitpod
 
For this project I used Code Institutes Python template that can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) (link).
 
**Steps to create a new repository in Github:**
 
1. Sign in or sign up to [GitHub](https://github.com) (link).
1. When you have done that, you will see `"new"` up in the left corner.
**Like this:**
![Screenshot new repository button github](/assets/readme/github.png)
1. Select in the dropdown menu under `Repository template` if you for example would like to use the template provided by `Code Institute` that I did for this project. If you don't see it in the dropdown menu click this [link](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) (link) to get to the one provided by `Code Institute` and click `Use this template` to the left of the green Gitpod button.
1. When you have done that, give the repository a name. Leave it public if you want anyone on the internet to see your repository (I always do).
1. Click create repository.
1. **Remember** to use the `commit` commands that I explained above so your hard work doesn't get lost if anything happens to Gitpod.
 
### Forking GitHub Repository
 
Forking a Github repository is the process of making a copy of someone else repository and add your own changes to it without changing the original, the original repository is known
as "upstream repository". I will explain the process of forking down below:
 
1. Go to the Github page that hosts the repository you wish to fork.
1. In the top-right corner of the page there is a button that says `"Fork"`.
1. Click this button.
1. This creates a copy of that repository to your Github home page. You can submit and receive changes to your copy by using pull requests and/or syncing with the original upstream repository.
 
This instructions were taken from [Github - Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) (link).
 
### Cloning GitHub Repository
 
Cloning a repository inolves making a full copy of a repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on the code easier. Changes can be pushed back up to the Github site or changes from other sources pulled to your local copy. I will explain how to clone down below:
 
1. Go to the repository page on Github.
1. Above the file list click on the green button that says `"Code"`.
1. You can choose to download a zip file of the repository, to unpack it on your local machine and open it in your IDE.
1. Clone using HTTPS by copying the URL under the HTTPS tab.
1. Open a terminal window, set current directory to the one you want to contain the clone from.
1. Type `git clone` and paste the URL copied from the Github page.
1. The repository clone will now be created on your machine.
 
This instructions were taken from [Github - cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) (link).
 
### Heroku
 
Deploying a project using Heroku:
 
* Don't forget to set your `DEBUG` in your `settings.py` file of your main app in `Django` to `False`.
* Ensure that all of your project dependencies are listed in the `requirments.txt` file.
* If not, then you can use this command in the Gitpod terminal: `pip3 freeze --local > requirments.txt`.
* Visit the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) (link) website and click on create an account.
* Click the `"New"` button.
* Click the `"Create new app"` button.
* Provide a name for the app in the `App` name input field.
* Select your region from the `"choose region"` dropdown menu.
* Click the `"Create App"` button.
* Once redirected, proceed to the settings tab.
* Click on the `"config vars"` button.
* Supply a `KEY` of `PORT` and it's value of `8000`. Then click the `"add"` button. Do this with `Cloudinary, Database URL (from Heroku-Postgres) and your secret key`.
* Next step is to add `Buildpacks`, click the `"Add Buildpack"` button.
* The `Heroku Postgress` buildpack need to be added.
* Once the buildpack have completed, go to the deploy tab, once on the deploy screen, select GitHub as the deployment method and connect your GitHub profile.
* Search for the repository that you wish to deploy to `Heroku` and click `"connect"`.
* Once your repository is connected to Heroku you can choose to either automatically or manually deploy your app. 
* By selecting automatic deploy, Heroku will build a new version of the app each time a change has been made and pushed to the repository on `GitHub`.
* Click on manual deploy to build your App. When complete, click on `View` to open up the live site on `Heroku`. 
* Finished.
 
If the `create app` process at `Heroku` website wouldn't work follow these steps:
* When you want to deploy your project to `Heroku`.
* Type `heroku login -i` to login to your existing account (if you have one) in the `Gitpod` terminal.
* Then run the command `heroku create your_app_name_here` to create a new app (the name has to be uniqe).
* Now you can see your new project at `Heroku` dashboard and set the config vars and buildpacks as the steps explained above.
